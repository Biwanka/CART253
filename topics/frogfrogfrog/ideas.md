# Starting points

**Frog eating flies but it gets harder and harder to catch them**

**I want to make a fly woble not be straight**

**I want the frog tongue to flicker when he eats the red fly because they are dangerous, show the frog is hurt,  (maybe see if the fill can change)**

**if eaten the evil fly more than 3 time its a game over**

**I want a fly to be super zoomy like crazy. I want to act differently than the rest if it is caught the player has to click a spefic key 10 time in a certain amount of time to win the game**

**I want multiple of the same fly to appear more than once at the same time random frog tongue move angle**
