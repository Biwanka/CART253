                                This painting subject is of the memory, from when I was a child, of discovering that I
                                had learning disabilities.
                                Portraying this out-of-body
                                experience of fear until a minute later, I realized I didn't know what they meant.
                                Bringing forth this absurd alienation
                                that is put towards the label of 'different' when it's not a bad thing.

                                Digital drawing educates people on ADHD. Many people do not know about learning
                                disability therefore they act harshly. I
                                have ADHD and have been labelled and shunned for it. ADHD does not make me different and
                                I want to make people aware of
                                this with my drawing.

                                This painting is a self-portrait. This painting depicts some of my non-visual
                                disabilities. I have chronic Migraines and
                                Nerve Damage from having shingles at the age of 19. Specifically, these two disabilities
                                affect my day-to-day life, as
                                they affect my productivity and more. Therefore, with art, I have to adapt. With art and
                                my family, I have been able to
                                adapt to these new changes, however, these are still daily pains that I live with. I
                                have come to an acceptance of these
                                new changes and this painting doesn't show how painful it is. This demonstrates my
                                tiredness and acceptance. The purple
                                me helps depict the look of my migraines and nerves, I also wanted to depict the
                                specific places affected by these small
                                nerve-like lines.(Bianca Gauthier, September 2023, 30x40 inch, Acrylic Painting)

                                This represents my fear of failure. I have been to a low point when I was younger
                                because of my learning disabilities. I
                                have worked hard to the top, but when I went into art with no experience, I was scared
                                to return to the bottom.This work utilizes graphite to create contrast between a range
                                of dark tones
