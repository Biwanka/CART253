      <h1>Information About Disabilities</h1>

      <!-- Introduction Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the information section of this website. Here, you can explore more about the disabilities that
          influence my
          work, studies, and creative processes. The aim is to create awareness and share my personal journey in
          navigating
          these challenges.

        </p>

        <p>As I navigate a landscape filled with ongoing tests and the constant adjustment of medications, I invite you
          to
          join me
          in this exploration. My journey is marked by resilience, creativity, and the pursuit of understanding—an
          endeavor that
          is both deeply personal and universally relevant. Here, you'll find insights into how these disabilities
          interconnect
          and impact my life, along with links to additional resources for each condition, so you can further your
          understanding
          of these experiences.

        <h1>Living with Disabilities - An Interactive Experience</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my interactive experimental website, a space dedicated to exploring the
          complexities of living with
          various
          disabilities, including chronic migraines, postherpetic neuralgia, ADHD, dyslexia, and high anxiety. Each of
          these
          conditions has shaped my personal and creative journey in profound ways, influencing my daily life, education,
          and
          artistic expression. Through candid storytelling and informative resources, I aim to shed light on the unique
          challenges
          and experiences that come with each disability.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is an interactive experience demonstrating the daily effects of certain disabilities I am
          diagnosed
          with.
          The experience is designed to be immersive and may affect users differently. While not meant to elicit pity or
          be
          completely comprehensive, it offers a glimpse into my personal experience with these conditions.
        </p>

        <p>The purpose of this website is for it to be an experience that users will
          not be able to stop completely. The experience is not planned to be good or bad, as it can affect people
          differently. The purpose is not to govern pity or to be fully informative. This website is trying to
          demonstrate
          some of the effects that I have from my disabilities, however, it isn't completely informative as I
          acknowledge
          that not everyone with any of these disabilities has the same experience. I will put links for each of these
          disabilities to websites that are informative if you would like to learn more in detail about any of these
          disabilities.

          Please note that this website is not intended to be a diagnostic tool or a source of professional advice. Each
          person’s
          experience with disabilities is unique, and the simulations and content here are based solely on my personal

      <!-- ADHD Section -->
      <div class="disability-section">
        <h2>ADHD</h2>
        <p>
          ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) affects focus, organization, and energy regulation. It
          significantly impacts
          my work by making it challenging to stay on track, especially with detailed projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My personal experience with ADHD includes hyper-focus on creative projects and difficulty managing mundane
          tasks.
          This has
          shaped how I approach art and coding, blending spontaneity with structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living with ADHD presents a constant balancing act, where focus and organization can often feel elusive. The
          challenge
          intensifies when medication no longer works as expected, requiring ongoing experimentation to find the right
          balance.
          Here are three informative links about ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder):

      <!-- Anxiety Section -->
      <div class="disability-section">
        <h2>Anxiety</h2>
        <p>
          Anxiety manifests in various ways, often intertwining with my other disabilities and affecting my overall
          well-being. As
          I manage the stress of ongoing medical tests and medication adjustments, it’s essential to find ways to cope
          and
          thrive.

        <p>
          Art becomes both a refuge and a challenge during migraine episodes. While it helps process emotions, the
          physical
          strain
          can be overwhelming.

      <!-- Dyslexia Section -->
      <div class="disability-section">
        <h2>Dyslexia</h2>
        <p>
          Dyslexia primarily affects reading, writing, and sometimes coding. I often encounter errors in syntax and
          spelling, which
          require extra effort to identify and correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          My unique journey with dyslexia has led me to develop visual techniques and methods to minimize its impact on
          my
          creative
          and academic work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dyslexia shapes my approach to both traditional art and new ventures like coding. While it can enhance
          creative
          thinking, the intricacies of language processing make navigating technical subjects particularly challenging.

      <!-- Chronic Migraines Section -->
      <div class="disability-section">
        <h2>Chronic Migraines</h2>
        <p>
          Migraines cause severe pain, sensitivity to light, and interruptions in productivity. Frequent migraines force
          me
          to adapt
          my workflow and manage my time around unpredictable episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Art becomes both a refuge and a challenge during migraine episodes. While it helps process emotions, the
          physical
          strain
          can be overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chronic migraines are more than just headaches; they are a debilitating condition that can disrupt everyday
          life,
          especially in educational and artistic pursuits. The unpredictable nature of migraines often leads to missed
          opportunities and feelings of isolation.
          Here are three informative links for chronic migraines:

      <div class="disability-section">
        <h2>Postherpethic Neuralgia</h2>

        <p>
          Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful reminder of a shingles outbreak, leaving behind lasting nerve damage that
          affects
          daily functioning. This condition introduces a unique set of challenges, influencing both my education and
          creative
          expression.
