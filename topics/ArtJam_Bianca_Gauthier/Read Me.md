Title: Cat PLay Time 
This project was inspired by my cats. So i thought of something that wasnt to extreme. So i decided to go with a cat playing 
with a laser Pointer. I didnt know how to get the laser pointer to move randomly wich felt like a little challenge. I had some difficulties but it worked in the end. I did use some codes as reference from past lectures. I used the structure of these codes:

 const distance = dist(catPaw.x, catPaw.y, laserPointer.x, laserPointer.y);
    const mouseOverlapsLaserPointer = (distance < laserPointer.size / 2);

and this one :   const mouseIsMoving = (movedX !== 0 || movedY !== 0);

they are from the tutorial of "creature love message" i used it to for the mouseOverlapsLaserPointer so that the laser Pointer will
only move when it is pressed. 
the second code was used for the changing colours of the floor. 

The cat paw itself I drew digitaly and then downloaded the png. 

I didnt have the idea of the floor changing colours at the beginning but, i dont remember how, but whne i was thinking of a map() i didnt want it to effect the laser pointer because it would take away the idea that it is a laserPointer. I then got the idea, with the thought that the cat was playing going in different rooms or the idea of time as the cat is playing for so long that it gets darker and brighter.
