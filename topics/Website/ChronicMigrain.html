                <h1>
                    Chronic Migraines
                </h1>
                <p id="blink_text">
                    Chronic migraines are a debilitating neurological condition characterized by frequent and intense
                    headache episodes,
                    often accompanied by a range of distressing symptoms. Individuals experiencing chronic migraines may
                    find their daily
                    lives significantly impacted, especially in educational settings where focus and concentration are
                    paramount. The
                    unpredictability of migraine attacks can lead to missed classes and an inability to participate
                    fully in discussions or
                    projects, creating feelings of isolation and frustration.

                </p>
                <p>In an artistic context, chronic migraines can interfere with the creative process. The throbbing
                    pain, visual
                    disturbances, and heightened sensitivity to light and sound can stifle inspiration and make it
                    challenging to engage in
                    artistic endeavours. Additionally, vestibular migraines, which can cause dizziness and balance
                    issues, further
                    complicate artistic expression, as movements may be restricted and the environment overwhelming.
                    Accompanying symptoms
                    such as acid reflux and numbness can add layers of discomfort, making it difficult to fully immerse
                    oneself in the
                    art-making process.
                </p>
                <p>For individuals living with chronic migraines, heat sensitivity can exacerbate symptoms, leading to a
                    constant awareness
                    of environmental conditions. This vigilance can distract from both learning and creating, forcing a
                    constant negotiation
                    between health and engagement. The cumulative effect of these challenges often results in a profound
                    sense of struggle,
                    as the individual works to balance their passion for education and art with the realities of their
                    condition.
                    Ultimately, chronic migraines can shape not just how one learns and creates, but also how one
                    interacts with the world, demanding resilience and adaptability in the face of ongoing adversity.
