      <h1>Living with Disabilities - An Interactive Experience</h1>
      <p>
        This website is an interactive experience demonstrating the daily effects of certain disabilities I am diagnosed
        with.
        The experience is designed to be immersive and may affect users differently. While not meant to elicit pity or
        be
        completely comprehensive, it offers a glimpse into my personal experience with these conditions.
      </p>

      <p>The purpose of this website is for it to be an experience that users will
        not be able to stop completely. The experience is not planned to be good or bad, as it can affect people
        differently. The purpose is not to govern pity or to be fully informative. This website is trying to demonstrate
        some of the effects that I have from my disabilities, however, it isn't completely informative as I acknowledge
        that not everyone with any of these disabilities has the same experience. I will put links for each of these
        disabilities to websites that are informative if you would like to learn more in detail about any of these
        disabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Welcome to my interactive experimental website, a space dedicated to exploring the complexities of living with
        various
        disabilities, including chronic migraines, postherpetic neuralgia, ADHD, dyslexia, and high anxiety. Each of
        these
        conditions has shaped my personal and creative journey in profound ways, influencing my daily life, education,
        and
        artistic expression. Through candid storytelling and informative resources, I aim to shed light on the unique
        challenges
        and experiences that come with each disability.

      </p>
      <p>As I navigate a landscape filled with ongoing tests and the constant adjustment of medications, I invite you to
        join me
        in this exploration. My journey is marked by resilience, creativity, and the pursuit of understanding—an
        endeavor that
        is both deeply personal and universally relevant. Here, you'll find insights into how these disabilities
        interconnect
        and impact my life, along with links to additional resources for each condition, so you can further your
        understanding
        of these experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>ADHD</h2>
      Living with ADHD presents a constant balancing act, where focus and organization can often feel elusive. The
      challenge
      intensifies when medication no longer works as expected, requiring ongoing experimentation to find the right
      balance.
      Here are three informative links about ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder):
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Offers a comprehensive overview of ADHD, including symptoms,
      diagnosis, and treatment options.

      thinking, the intricacies of language processing make navigating technical subjects particularly challenging.

      dyslexia.

      <h2>Anxiety</h2>
      Anxiety manifests in various ways, often intertwining with my other disabilities and affecting my overall
      well-being. As
      I manage the stress of ongoing medical tests and medication adjustments, it’s essential to find ways to cope and
      thrive.

      <h2>Chronic Migrains</h2>
      Chronic migraines are more than just headaches; they are a debilitating condition that can disrupt everyday life,
      especially in educational and artistic pursuits. The unpredictable nature of migraines often leads to missed
      opportunities and feelings of isolation.
      Here are three informative links for chronic migraines, including those with aura and vestibular migraines:

      chronic
      migraines and those with aura.
      American Migraine Foundation

      <h2>Postherpetic Neuralgia</h2>
      Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful reminder of a shingles outbreak, leaving behind lasting nerve damage that
      affects
      daily functioning. This condition introduces a unique set of challenges, influencing both my education and
      creative
      expression.

      neuralgia, including symptoms, causes, and treatment options.
