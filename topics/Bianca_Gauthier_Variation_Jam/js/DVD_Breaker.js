/**
 * Brick Breaker
 * Bianca Gauthier
 * 
 * Im going to be using a game that is very nastalgic as I use to always play it on my dads phone when i was very young. 
 * The game is Brick Breakers specifically the one on the Blackberry. I waill create a couple different variations of the game. 
 * 
 * 
 * the concept of the original game : 
 * 
 * you have a paddle, a ball and there are bricks in the game. your paddle stays at the bottom of the game. 
 * the player can only move the paddle left and right. 
 * the ball will bounce of the paddle and will bounce in anny direction like a ball (it dosent curve but can go in diagonals).
 * if the player dosent catch the ball with teh paddle and the ball falls at the bottom the player looses a life.
 * the purpose of the game is for the ball to hit the bricks and break them until none are left to win the game. 
 * the ball can bouce of the side of the game and the top just not the bottom. 
 * in the game some brick that are darker needs to be hit 3 times before breaking will the paler are just once.
 * later in the game they alos have steel bricks that you cant break just bounce off. 
 * 
 * 
 * the ideas for variations:
 * 
 * 1- when the ball hits a brick, teh brick dosent break but starts to fall downwards.
 *  if the player dosent catch the falling bricks with the paddle the bricks will freeze at the bottom and sty there.
 * this will block the paddle. so if alot of bricks are not cought it could block the player from moving the paddle.
 * 
 * 
 * 2- 4 corners. the concept of the original game is that the paddle is only at the bottom.
 * but with this variation the paddle will be able to go on all the 4 size.
 * depending on the coding it will only be one paddle that can move to all 4 sides or if not its that there will be 4 paddle 
 * one on each side that can be move seperatly. the ball will now not be able to bounce of any of the sides. 
 * and the brick will be placed in the middle of the screen
 * 
 * 
 * 3- DvD logo. because the game i chose had to do with something from my past i decided to all add another aspect that touches on that.
 * I am going to use the boucing DVD logo. it was a common thing if you ever owned a DVD that when it was left on pause for long
 * the logo would appear and start bouching on the 4 sides of the screen. The main Hype was when the logo actually finally hit the 
 * corner of the screen it was the biggest satisfaction. Mainly i will use the top right corner. so i will change teh ball to be the 
 * DvD logo and the ball will be able to hit the side of the screen. there will be bricks blocking the top right corner.
 * Even if the player gets ride of all the bricks they will not win the game they need to continue until the DVD logo witht perfectly 
 * the top right corner.
 * 
 * 
 * 4- Reverse. I dedcide to make a version that will be the contrary of the cncept of the original game. 
 * instead of bouncing a ball on a paddle to break the bricks, instead the player will need to trow the bricks to hit the ball
 * that is moving in the top screen. the player will have a pile of bricks and need to trow them so it hits the ball and the brick breaks.
 * if the brick hits nothing gravity will do its thing and come back down in the hands of the player. im think maybe to add a timer 
 * where the palyer needs to break all the brick before the time. we will see.
