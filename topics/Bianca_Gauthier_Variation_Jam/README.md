## Description

Im going to be using a game that is very nastalgic as I use to always play it on my dad phone when i was very young. 
 The game is Brick Breakers specifically the one on the Blackberry. I will create a couple different variations of the game. Some do not have a GameOver screen yet. Many of the variations I have other ideas to add, but the main point was to have fun and explore how brick breaker could be experienced differently. 

## Credits

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
It used the concept of the main Brick Breaker Game.
All the visuals are done by me.
I did use the function centredRectanglesOverlap(a, b) that was shown in class and the start of the ball and paddle thta was in the same lecture
