# Starting points
 some of my ideas 
**Frog eating flies but it gets harder and harder to catch them**

**I want to make a fly woble not be straight**

**I want the frog tongue to flicker when he eats the red fly because they are dangerous, show the frog is hurt,  (maybe see if the fill can change)**

**if eaten the evil fly more than 3 time its a game over**

**I want a fly to be super zoomy like crazy. I want to act differently than the rest if it is caught the player has to click a spefic key 10 time in a certain amount of time to win the game**

**I want multiple of the same fly to appear more than once at the same time random frog tongue move angle**


what was added and reason.

I found my inspiration to the appraoch to the arcade games in webkinz. I thought of making the tongue move in a demi circle bakc and forth but ended up doing other things. 

I added a scoring system and a life system.
for the lives it was suppose to be only 3 lives and when we end up a 0 we get a game over. However when i had an error somehwere my lives ended up going to -1 and I found it interesting as it is such a common knowledge that at 0 it would be a game Over . Therefore i ended up making my lives go down to -1. wanting to kind of take the players by suprise. 

i added a variety of different flies to work around having a variety of different movement and working with the code.
